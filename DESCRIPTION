Description: This package provides tutorials for R Packages by Hadley Wickham
  and Jennifer Bryan. In an ideal world, students would read the book and type
  in all the associated R commands themselves. Sadly, that often does not
  happen. These tutorials allow students to demonstrate (and their instructors
  to be sure) that all work has been completed. See the tutorial.helpers
  package for a background discussion of the tool and approach.
